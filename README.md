# WholeBrainRabiesAnalysis

This repository contains a set of python and R scripts for data analysis in Yao, et al. (2024). These scripts are currently available as-is.
Data required to generate the figures can be found in the "data" folder, and the expected outputs are saved in the "output" folder.

## Level of support
We are not currently supporting this code, but simply releasing it to the community AS IS but are not able to provide any guarantees of support.
